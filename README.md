## About the repository:    
This repository is a solution to Assignment B-3 of the STAT 545B course  

## About the application:
1. It is a shiny app to analyse the temperature conditions required for different crops  
2. The user can select a crop from the given list of crops as an input, to analyse the temperature conditions  
required for the crop to grow from a box plot
3. Along with the box plot, a table of different parameters required by the crop along with the temperature has been shown,
to help the user understand more about the crop
3. The user can also download the table of sorted contents in the form of a CSV file
